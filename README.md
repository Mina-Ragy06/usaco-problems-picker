### How to use
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Remove the `.temp` from files' extensions (`active.json`, `all.json`, `skipped.json`, `solved.json`).
3. Run `fetch.js` to fetch problems using the command `node fetch.js`.
4. Run `main.js` to do whatever you want using the command `node main.js`.
5. For `fetch.js` and `main.js`, press enter to confirm selection.

- To update the problemset, download the `content` folder from https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/ and replace the `content` folder here with it.
- To update the script without losing your progress, only update `fetch.js` and `main.js` unless otherwise was mentioned.
